What is Language Models
Language Models (LM) is a probability distribution over sequences of 
tokens. Suppose we have a vocabulary 𝑉 of a set of tokens. LM 𝑝 
assigns each sequence of tokens 𝑤1, … , 𝑤𝑛∈𝑉 a probability
𝑝(𝑤1, … , 𝑤𝑛)
This probability intuitively tells us how “good” a sequence of tokens is.
Example:
p(the, mouse, ate, the, cheese) = 0.02
p(the, cheese, ate, the, mouse) = 0.01
p(mouse, the, the, cheese, ate) = 0.0001"

Please provide a different slide or additional content for detailed technical explanation.","8
What is Language Models
LM should have the ability to assign meaningful probability to all 
sequences, which requires sophisticated (but implicit) linguistic abilities 
and world knowledge.
Example:
p(the, mouse, ate, the, cheese) = 0.02 -> higher prob, world knowledge
p(the, cheese, ate, the, mouse) = 0.01
p(mouse, the, the, cheese, ate) = 0.0001 -> ungrammatical, syntactic 
knowledge"

What is Language Models
LM takes a sequence and returns a probability to assess its goodness.
𝑝𝑤1, … , 𝑤𝑛
= p 𝑤1  ∗ 𝑝𝑤2 𝑤1  ∗𝑝𝑤3 𝑤1, 𝑤2 ∗ … ∗𝑝(𝑤𝑛|𝑤1, 𝑤2, … , 𝑤𝑛−1)
p(cat sat on the mat) = p(cat) * p(sat | cat) * p(on | cat sat) *

What is Large Language Models
▪Small models: under 100 million parameters (useful for lightweight 
tasks, edge devices, or fine-tuning)
▪Medium models: 100M – 1B parameters (comparable to early 
transformer models like BERT-base)
▪Large models: 1B – 10B parameters (often considered “large” in many 
research papers).
▪Very large models: 10B – 100B parameters (models like GPT-3 with 
175B fall here).
▪Frontier-scale models: 100B+ parameters (GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini 
1.5 Pro, etc.)."

what you want to do, you can choose the default project, but you are 
expected to try to extend and improve it in various ways of your 
choice, like contrastive learning, paraphrasing, regularized optimization

Large Language Models (https://aclanthology.org/ provides paper 
database)
Should clearly state the previous codebase and highlight your 
contribution in presentation and final report. Only running the existing 
code will not get a good score. You are encouraged to extend and 
improve the original paper, like improvements to the model, providing 
ablations or experimental studies that the original paper did not provide,

Note about Final Project
▪The project topics should be human-language related, or text-related 
tasks, or multi-modality (including text-modality) tasks
▪A successful custom final project may develop a novel method or 
algorithm, but studying existing methods or applying them to new 
problems can also lead to interesting results without inventing 
something new.
▪A successful custom final project may improve on some existing SOTA, 
but well-executed projects that perform thoughtful experiments and 
produce negative results, projects that just aim to build a fun system, or 
projects that answer an interesting research question without advancing 
SOTA are equally valuable."

Note about Final Project (continued)
▪A successful final project should have clearly-defined evaluation 
metrics to measure the outcome of whatever experiment(s) you run; 
exact-match accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on either in-
distribution or out-of-distribution test data are used to evaluate 
experiments in the default final project.
▪A successful final project is encouraged to have a short, specific guiding 
question or hypothesis. An example of good guiding questions ‘Does 
fine-tuning some BERT layers work better than others, and is the best 
layer to fine-tune the same for all tasks?’ or ‘Does pre-training in one 
language still help if we fine-tune on a different language?’"

Note about Final Project (continued)
▪The models used for experiments are not restricted to language models 
with very large size. We do allow small or medium size language 
models for experiments. The key point is not the model size you use 
for experiments, but the research questions you find is valuable, the 
experiment design is reasonable and solid, your analysis is thoughtful, 
the evaluation is comprehensive.
▪Students are expected to not rely solely on calling LLMs API for their 
experiments. Prompting LLMs is allowed, but you should also at least 
train or fine-tune language model (even small language models) to 
compare results.
▪Every team is encouraged to submit a paper to ACL (discuss with me)"

assessment. If the letter does not meet these requirements, the student 
must provide the instructor with documentation that complies with UF’s 
official excused absence policy (https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-

Limitations of Instruction Tuning
▪It’s expensive to collect ground truth data for tasks
▪Tasks like open-ended creative generation have no right answer
e.g. Write me a story about a dog and her pet grasshopper.
▪Humans generate suboptimal answers
▪Even with instruction finetuning, there a mismatch between the LM 
objective and the objective of “satisfying human preferences”"

▪This is how LLM work: (1) LLMs are trained to predict words (2) 
LLMs generate text by predicting the next word repeatedly."

N-gram Language Model
▪N-gram Language Model – the simplest kind of language model
▪What is n-gram: n-gram is a sequence of n words
2-gram (bigram) = two-word sequence of words, e.g. the cat, cat sat…
3-gram (trigram) = three-word sequence of words, e.g. the cat sat …
▪N-gram LM is a probabilistic model that can estimate the prob of a 
word given the N-1 previous words, and thereby to assign prob for 
entire sequences"

using relative frequency counts"

Problems of relative frequency counts
▪Not accurate because new sentences are invented all the time

   counts of every possible sentences
▪Computational heavy for sequence with long length n

Intrinsic Evaluation – split datasets
▪Training set: is the data we use to learn the parameter of model
For the N-gram LM, training data is the data from which we get the n-
gram counts to estimate n-gram probability
▪Testing set: is a set of unseen data that is not overlapping with training 
set, that we use to evaluate the model
If a LM assigns a higher probability to the test set, that means it more 
accurately predicts the test set, then it is a better model.
▪Development set: used to tune hyper-parameter"

Intrinsic Evaluation – metric
▪Recall: if a LM assigned a higher probability to the test set, it is better
▪Question: Can we use probability as the evaluation metric?
We do not use the raw probability as the metric, because the prob of a 
test set depends on the number of words/tokens – the prob gets smaller if 
the test text is longer.
▪Metric: Perplexity (a metric normalized by sequence length, per-word)"

▪Recall: a LM is a probability distribution over a sequence of tokens 
where each token comes from some vocabulary V
  
▪However, natural language doesn’t come as a sequence of tokens, 
but just as a string"

▪Tokenization is a process that converts any text string into a 
sequence of tokens, which can be words, sub-words, characters

processed by a LM"

Why we need Tokenization
▪The language data is in textual form, but language model (or any 
machine learning models) process numbers, and tokenization helps 
convert text into numbers that is readable by models
▪LLM training and inference workflows need to process each token as 
unique integer, and map each unique integer into a vector embedding, 
and feed vector embedding as input into language model"

Why we need Tokenization

Character-level Tokenization
What about character-level tokenization? (token = character)

Character-level Tokenization
There exists several problems:
▪Difficult when dealing with diverse languages:
This method does not account for languages other than the language for 
which you created vocabulary lookup tables
▪Difficult when dealing with long sequences: 
The vocabulary size is small (number of characters), but the sequence 
length of tokenized sentences will be much larger. Because LLM usually 
has fixed window size, LLM will process much less data at a time."

in vocabulary initialization and frequency score calculation"

Feedforward Neural Language Models
▪How to train this model? Use a lot of raw text to create training examples 
and run gradient-descent optimization
▪Limitations: (1) W linearly scales with the context size m (2) The model 
learns separate patterns for different positions
▪Better solutions: Recurrent NNs, Transformers
“sat on” corresponds to different parameters in W"

Problems that still exists:
▪Fixed window size is small
▪Window size growth enlarges W
